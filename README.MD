# gbajam21

The GBA Jam 2021 was an homebrew competition hosted by [gbadev.net](https://gbadev.net) to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Game Boy Advance. Contestants had 3 months (from April 10th 2021 at 12:00 AM to July 12th 2021 at 12:00 AM) to develop something new running on the GBA, using whatever tools they wanted.

The competition was hosted at [itch.io/jam/gbajam21](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam21).
